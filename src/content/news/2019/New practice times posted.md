Update: Weapon specific practice times have now been posted.

With a new season comes new practice times.  I've posted the new times [here](/programs/regular-practice).

Just a couple of notes, we will be weapon restricting the practices but we haven't worked out which days/times are which weapons.  We will likely be splitting practice two into 1.5 or 2 hour sessions which will be weapon specific(sort of mini practices).  The beginners course will start the week after frosh week and will be held in the Norm Fenn Gym at 9:00pm-10:30 and then on Saturday mornings 10:00- 11:30. So for the first 5-6 weeks those practices are not available as regular practices.  Stay tuned for updates
