Last night we held our free introduction to fencing class.  We had over 30 people show up and try fencing for the first time.  Lots of fun was had by all.  Hopefully Wesley didn't scare them off and we see them all next Wednesday!. 

If you missed the first class night don't worry you can still show up next Wednesday at 9:00pm in the Norm Fenn gym jump in with the rest of the class.  Just let the instructors or one of the varsity athletes know and they will bring you up to speed.
