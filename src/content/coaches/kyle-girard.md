Kyle is a former Men’s Sabre National Champion and member of the national team who competed internationally for over 10 years. He is also a community level-1 certified coach with over 12 years’ experience at the varsity and national levels.

Kyle has a passion for coaching that lead him to take it up before he retired from his own competitive career. As a National Champion and member of the national team, he knows what it takes to succeed at the highest levels. He’s helped hundreds of beginners discover a love for fencing and has guided many from their first lunges to top 16 national level finishes.

The best coaching strategy is one that takes the student into account. Kyle works with each of his students to take advantage of their individual strengths and improve on their weaknesses. Favouring a blend of Hungarian and French styles, Kyle emphasises the importance of fundamentals, without making lessons tedious exercises in rote learning. The end result is a balance of finesse and power on the physical side, with a clever and adaptive approach on the strategic side.
