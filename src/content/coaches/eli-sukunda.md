Eli has been coaching the Carleton University Ravens fencing team since 1993. Entering his 22nd year as head coach of the team, Sukunda’s success as a fencer has helped to establish a reputable program at Carleton University.

Sukunda is a three -time Olympian fencer who competed in Montreal, Los Angeles and Seoul. He was a gold and bronze medalist in Sabre at the Commonwealth Games in 1982 and a bronze medalist at the 1983 Pan American Games.

He has coached the National Fencing Team at three World Championships including the Men’s Sabre team in 1993 and the Women’s Sabre team in 1998 and 1999.

In 2009-2010, he led the men’s and women’s fencing teams to gold in front of the home crowd. It marked the second OUA title in the history of the Ravens women’s program and the men’s first championship since 2000-2001. It was also the first time both the men’s and women’s teams have captured gold in the same year. For leading the Ravens fencing team to one of its most successful seasons, Sukunda was named the 2010 Carleton University Coach of the Year.
