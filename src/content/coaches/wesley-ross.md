Wesley is one of the greatest fencers, if not athletes, of all time. And totally not the guy who wrote these bios.

A former member of the High Performance Program, he has eight years’ experience competing at the international and national levels. A true product of the Carleton University fencing program, he started his career in the Beginner’s Program in his second year of university and worked his way up to become a varsity, provincial and regional champion.

Wesley works with new fencers to help guide them from initial interest through to an effective practice schedule and finally onto a competition footing. His coaching philosophy is rooted in helping a student understand why an action is important, giving the student agency in their own development. Lastly, he is a firm believer in an understanding attitude off the strip, with no quarter given on it. When you step on the field of play, every touch is earned.
