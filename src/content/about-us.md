title: About Us
---

The Carleton University Fencing Club caters to all levels of ability, ages and weapons. We are the community affiliation of the Carleton University Fencing Team, which competes on the OUA varsity circuit. We welcome members of the Ottawa community from 12 to 80 years old and from never-picked-up-a-sword beginners to National Champions. Anyone with prior fencing experience is welcome to join our practices, while those new to the sport are invited to take part in our Beginnerâ€™s Class. Whether you enjoy foil, epee or sabre, or even a mix of the three, we offer a fun, friendly environment where everyone can work on their skills, learn some new moves, and stab their friends right in the chest.
